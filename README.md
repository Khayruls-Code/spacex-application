# SpaceX App

Project preview Link [SpaceX Dashboard](https://spacex-dashboard-2022.netlify.app/).

## Technologies

React JS, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript, Tailwint CSS

## Necessary Install

### `Tailwind CSS`

I have used Tailwind CSS in this project. I follow the rules of setting up tailwind CSS in react JS. The whole project is styled by tailwind CSS without writing extra CSS.

### `eslint`

"eslint" has been used to create my own linting rules. To set up eslint, eslint, eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin, eslint-plugin-react, babel-eslint have been installed as devDependencies.

### `redux tookit`

I have used the redux toolkit to manage all states of this project. To use the redux toolkit need to install two packages  (1)@reduxjs/toolkit and (2)react-redux

### `moment`

I have used the moment package to filter data by last week, last month, and last year. The moment is a package which helps is parsing, validating, manipulating and displaying date/time in JavaScript in a very easy way.

### `react icons`

react icons has been installed to use icons

### `Jest`

I've used Jest to test the application. We need some other packages to work with Jest. That's why @testing-library/react, jest-dom, and react-test-renderer are installed here.

## Deploy Process

I've deployed the app on netlify. The process is very simple.

1. Firstly, to build the app, have to run "npm run build" command. The build will be finished shortly and there will be created a folder named build in the root directory.

2. Then, We have to log in on netlify.

3. There has a menu named Sites and have to click on this menu. 

4. Here a section is written, "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site output folder here". 

5. To deploy the application we have to drag and drop the build folder here.

That's how I deployed the project on netlify.
